  a. Extract the downloaded ``.zip`` archive. Replace {SOURCE-PATH} with
     the path to the directory where you downloaded the ``.zip``
     archive. Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory
     where you want to extract the archive.

     
     .. code-block:: sh

        unzip {SOURCE-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version}.zip -d {DESTINATION-PATH}

  b. Change to the ``mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version}`` directory.
     Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory
     where you extracted the archive in the previous step.

     .. code-block:: sh

        cd {DESTINATION-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version}/
  
  c. Install the programs within the ``bin/`` directory into a directory
     listed in your system ``PATH``. If a prior version exists, 
     overwrite the binaries.

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo install -m755 bin/mongo* /usr/local/bin/
...
